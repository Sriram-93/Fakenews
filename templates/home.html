        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <p>In recent years, the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news has become a significant issue across digital platforms, affecting public opinion and leading to misinformed decision-making. With the vast amount of content generated online, it’s challenging for individuals and even platforms to differentiate between credible information and fake news.</p>
        
        <p>This problem is critical, especially in domains like health, politics, and finance, where misinformation can have severe consequences. The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that accurately identifies and classifies news articles as either "fake" or "real." By analyzing various textual features—such as linguistic cues, sentiment, source credibility, and patterns typical of fake news—this solution aims to provide a scalable, efficient, and robust tool to support media platforms, fact-checkers, and users in making informed decisions.</p>
